## üöÄ The Journey: From Idea to Application

This project began with a single prompt:

> *"I need to build a tool that shows you how you rank against your competitors on SERPs, ranks your content, word count, keywords in the industry they are ranking for, performance on search(SEO)..."*

From that initial seed, Where I Rank SEO was born - a tool designed to give you crystal-clear insights into how you stack up against your competition in the search engine battlefield.

## üí° The Problem We're Solving

SEO professionals and website owners are constantly asking:
- How do I compare to my competitors in search results?
- What content strategies are winning in my industry?
- Which keywords should I be targeting?
- Why are my competitors outranking me?

Traditional SEO tools often provide overwhelming data without actionable insights. Where I Rank SEO cuts through the noise to give you exactly what you need to know.
